\abstract{Open Source software gives users the freedom to copy, modify and redistribute source code without having to pay any amount of money to an organization or individual. The evolution of these softwares usually depend a lot on how the participating crowd interact and co-operate with each other. Over the past few years, open source software have become widely accepted and used hence making their study a very hot topic. To understand the working philosophy of any open source software one needs to look into a variety of factors like community interaction, strength, evolution, support and contribution patterns. Bitergia is one such organization which is highly involved in getting, providing and analyzing Software Development metrics and information for open source projects. The main idea behind this thesis work is to understand contribution patterns by the community in few open source projects by the means of various visualizations. Data visualization has gained a lot of popularity as it helps in easy analysis of huge amounts of information quickly. We have hence taken up the task of improving the existing visualizations by Bitergia into visualizations which will help in taking informed decisions clearly.Our analysis were performed on five different datasets : Eclipse Foundation, OpenStack Foundation, Puppet Labs, Red Hat and Apache Cloudstack.}
